/**
 * Resolves the tile thumbnail for a reel.
 *
 * Priority:
 *  1. A live `thumbnail_url`/`vcdn_poster_url` (persisted and still served).
 *  2. The VCDN BFF poster for the reel's `vcdn://` pointer. This is the real fix:
 *     rows persisted before VCDN moved its posters to cdn.example.invalid keep a dead
 *     `storage.example.invalid` URL, so we re-resolve it on the fly instead of leaving the
 *     tile gray. The BFF poster URL is stable, so it is cached in memory.
 *
 * Resolution happens off the main thread (Compose effect), so the grid never blocks.
